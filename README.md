### 1. Duplicate Confirmation Email Issue

**File:** `src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`  
**Severity:** High  
**Status:** ✅ Resolved

**Problem Overview**

- The confirmation email was being triggered **twice** during form submission.
- Users were ending up with **duplicate emails**, leading to unnecessary confusion.

**Reason Identified**

- Found **duplicate `supabase.functions.invoke('send-confirmation')`** calls within `handleSubmit`.

**Implemented Fix**

```ts
// Removed the second redundant email sending block
const { error: emailError } = await supabase.functions.invoke(
  "send-confirmation",
  {
    body: {
      name: formData.name,
      email: formData.email,
      industry: formData.industry,
    },
  }
);
```

**Result**  
✅ Single email is now sent per submission  
✅ Prevented duplicate triggers  
✅ Reduced redundant API invocations

### 2. Lead Storage Not Working

**File:** `src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Status:** ✅ Resolved

**Problem Overview**

- Leads were **not being recorded** in the database.
- Even though the form appeared successful, no data was stored.

**Root Cause**

- Missing logic to persist leads
- No check for email duplication or insert failure

**Implemented Fix**

```ts
// Check if email already exists
const { data: existingLead, error: checkError } = await supabase
  .from("leads")
  .select("email")
  .eq("email", formData.email)
  .single();

// If not exists, insert new lead
const { error: insertError } = await supabase.from("leads").insert({
  name: formData.name,
  email: formData.email,
  industry: formData.industry,
});
```

**Result**  
✅ Leads are now properly stored  
✅ Checks for duplicates before inserting  
✅ Robust error handling in place

### 3. Toast Notifications for User Feedback

**File:** `src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** ✅ Implemented

**Feature Overview**

- Added toast notifications for better clarity on submission outcomes.

**Notification Logic**

```ts
// Success
toast({ title: "Success!", description: "Lead submitted successfully!" });

// Already exists
toast({
  title: "Lead Already Exists",
  description: "This lead already exists.",
  variant: "destructive",
});

// DB insert error
toast({
  title: "Error",
  description: "Failed to save your information. Please try again.",
  variant: "destructive",
});

// Unexpected error
toast({
  title: "Error",
  description: "An unexpected error occurred. Please try again.",
  variant: "destructive",
});
```

**Result**  
✅ Instant feedback on submission status  
✅ Enhanced user interaction experience  
✅ Clear error visibility

### 4. Submission Loading State with Spinner

**File:** `src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`  
**Severity:** Low (UX)  
**Status:** ✅ Improved

**Problem Overview**

- Submissions could be triggered **multiple times quickly**.
- Lack of indication for in-progress actions.

**Fix Summary**

```tsx
// Track submit state
const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false);

// In button
disabled = { isSubmitting };
{
  isSubmitting ? (
    <>
      <Loader2 className="w-5 h-5 mr-2 animate-spin" />
      Submitting...
    </>
  ) : (
    <>
      <CheckCircle className="w-5 h-5 mr-2" />
      Get Early Access
    </>
  );
}
```

**Result**  
✅ Prevents accidental double-clicks  
✅ Shows a loading animation  
✅ Streamlined UI behavior during submit
